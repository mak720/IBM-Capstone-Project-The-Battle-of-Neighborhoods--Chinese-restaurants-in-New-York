New York City itself contains by far the highest ethnic Chinese population of any individual city outside Asia, estimated at 628,763 as of 2017. Between 2000 and 2015, the population of foreign-born Chinese people in NYC grew by nearly 50 percent, the second-fastest-growing immigrant group, according to government data. At New York University alone, the population of Chinese international students more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, something that\u2019s already impacted the East Village dining scene.\n New York City is experiencing a Chinese food renaissance. Never before have the city\u2019s offerings been so diverse; not only are multiple regions represented, but price points range, too. A huge audience of discerning Chinese expats who seek flavors from home is fueling a highly competitive market of contemporary regional Chinese restaurants \u2014 one that means all of New York has access to a restaurant scene that\u2019s better than it\u2019s ever been. \nDespite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, chinese restaurants have reopened faster than any other category of independent restaurant. On March 30, 94% of Chinese restaurants were closed, compared with 61% of the city\u2019s other restaurants. By June 20, the number of closures had fallen to 10%.\nAs follows from the above, New York City attracts many to start their business in the Chinese food industry. Before opening your business, you need to correctly determine the location, for which you need to analyze the situation with existing restaurants, their specifics and ratings in different areas of New York. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
